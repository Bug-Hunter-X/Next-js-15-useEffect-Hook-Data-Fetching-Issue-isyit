# Next.js 15 useEffect Hook Data Fetching Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `useEffect` hook in Next.js 15 applications to fetch data. The issue is that the component doesn't re-render after the data is successfully fetched from an API, leaving the user with a persistent 'Loading...' state.

## Problem
The `About.js` page fetches data from an API route (`/api/data`). This route simulates a 2-second delay before sending a JSON response.  The `useEffect` hook fetches the data, but the component doesn't update its display to show the fetched data. It remains stuck on 'Loading...' even after the API call successfully completes.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the component re-renders after the data has been fetched. This can be achieved by using a state variable and updating it with the new data. The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of `About.js`.  The key change is updating the state variable correctly after data is received from the API call.
